## Bootstrap 4 Support

Pezza• Design System is built on top of the much-awaited Bootstrap 4. This makes starting a new project very simple. It also provides benefits if you are already working on a Bootstrap 4 project; you can just import the Blk• Design System style over it. Most of the elements have been redesigned; but if you are using an element we have not touched, it will fall back to the Bootstrap default.

## Getting Started

We've also included an optional Gulp file to help you get started with theme customization. You'll need to install Node.js and Gulp before using our included gulpfile.js.

1. Download the project's zip
2. Make sure you have node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
3. Type `npm install` in terminal/console in the source folder where `package.json` is located
4. You will find all the branding colors inside `assets/scss/design-system/custom/_variables.scss`. You can change them with a `HEX` value or with other predefined variables.
5. Run in terminal `gulp compile-scss` for a single compilation or `gulp watch` for continous compilation of the changes that you make in `*.scss` files. This command should be run in the same folder where `gulpfile.js` and `package.json` are located
6. Run in terminal `gulp default` for opening the Dashboard Page (default) of the product.

## Example Pages
